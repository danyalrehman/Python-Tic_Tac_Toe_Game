Tic-Tac-Toe
===========

University of Toronto Programming Project. 

In first year one of our projects was to design a Tic-Tac-Toe Game using Object Oriented Programming in Python. This is the end result. One has to enter column and row numnbers depending on where they want to put an X or an O. So going from left to right you have [0,0], [0,1], [0,2] next row [1,0], [1,1] etc. Lastly it tells you who wins.
